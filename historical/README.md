The files Spec_JavaScriptSharedMemoryAtomicsandLocks.odt and
Spec_JavaScriptSharedMemoryAtomicsandLocks.pdf represent the same
archived content.

The former preserves the comment threads from Google Docs, but it
preserves *all* comment threads, including the closed ones.  This is
not ideal, because most threads were closed.

The latter does not preserve the comment threads.  This is not ideal,
because not all threads were closed.

Ditto for SharedMemoryAtomicsLocks-asm.js-additions.odt and
SharedMemoryAtomicsLocks-asm.js-additions.pdf.
