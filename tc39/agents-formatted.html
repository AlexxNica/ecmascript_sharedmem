<p> Early draft.  Revised: 2016-02-19 </p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1><span class="secnum"></span>Introduction<span class="utils"><span class="anchor"><a href="#intro">#</a></span></span></h1>

<p> This is a companion spec to the Shared memory and Atomics specification
  ("SAB spec", for short).  The purpose of the present specification is to nail
  down exactly what that the SAB spec means when it refers to "agent", and to
  place the runtime semantic operations that the SAB spec depends on on solid
  ground.  </p>

<p> About terminology: I'm going to use "agent" for the time being since that is
  what the SAB spec uses; C++ uses it too, for its similar concept.  Other terms
  that have been championed are "vat" and "continent", and we can bikeshed a
  name later (I'm not opposed to either).  It is also possible that an "agent"
  as required by the SAB spec is not quite what has been discussed as a "vat" or
  "continent" in the past, but I'm trying not to deviate from what I've read
  about those.  </p>

<p> TODO items:  </p>
<ul>
  <li> Do we need to expose semantic operations on agents, or is what we
    have good enough?  Operations could be: adding a job to an agent's
    queue; message send and receive (abstractly); introspection on the
    agent's state.  It's possible that the SAB spec will need some of these
    to implement its happens-before relation, not sure yet.

    <p> An  <em>agent</em> comprises a set of ECMAScript execution environments,
      an <emu-xref href="#sec-execution-contexts"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-execution-contexts">execution context</a></emu-xref> stack, a running <emu-xref href="#sec-execution-contexts"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-execution-contexts">execution context</a></emu-xref> for that
      agent, a set of named job queues, per-agent attributes, and an executing
      thread.  Except for the executing thread, the constituents of an agent
      belong exclusively to that agent.  </p>

    <emu-note><span class="note">Note 1</span>
      <p> (See ES6 8.3) When the ECMAScript specification references the  <em>running
	  <emu-xref href="#sec-execution-contexts"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-execution-contexts">execution context</a></emu-xref></em> it always does so in the dynamic context of
	a particular agent, and it will use the running <emu-xref href="#sec-execution-contexts"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-execution-contexts">execution context</a></emu-xref> of that agent.  </p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note><span class="note">Note 2</span>
      <p> (See ES6 8.4) When the ECMAScript specification looks up a job queue such as
	in <emu-xref aoid="EnqueueJob"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-enqueuejob">EnqueueJob</a></emu-xref> and <emu-xref aoid="NextJob"><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-nextjob-result">NextJob</a></emu-xref>, those operations are always performed
	in the dynamic context of a particular agent, and will find that
	agent's job queues exclusively.  </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> An agent's executing thread executes the jobs in the agent's job queues
      on the agent's execution contexts independently of other agents.  An
      execution thread may be used as the execution thread by multiple agents
      only if none of the agents sharing the thread have  <b>canBlock</b>
      attributes that are <emu-const>true</emu-const>.  </p>

    <emu-note><span class="note">Note 3</span>
      <p> This is a case of bowing to reality, since browsers do share the main
	thread across tabs in the same process and will prohibit main-thread
	code to block.  The damage to the forward progress guarantee from
	allowing sharing is only slight so long as blocking is precluded.  </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> The set of per-agent attributes is at least this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b> littleEndian  </b>: the default value computed for
	the  <em>littleEndian</em> parameter when it is needed by E262 algorithms. 
	Set at agent creation time; constant.
      
      </li><li> <b> canBlock  </b>: determines whether the agent can block to wait for an
	external unblock event or not.  Set at agent creation time; constant.
      
      </li><li> <b> state  </b>: the state of the agent.  A string, it can take on the 
	following values:
	
	<ul>
	  <li> <b> Starting  </b>: agent is in the process of being created
	  
	  </li><li> <b> Waiting  </b>: agent is waiting for work to appear in a queue
	  
	  </li><li> <b> Running  </b>: agent is processing a job
	  
	  </li><li> <b> Blocked  </b>: agent has put itself to sleep
	  
	  </li><li> <b> Closing  </b>: agent is in the process of being destroyed
	  
	  </li><li> <b> Closed  </b>: agent has been destroyed
	
	</li></ul>
    </li></ul>

    <p> If an agent has a representation within an ECMAScript program it is as a
      host object value.  </p>

    <p> Programs within different agents may communicate by unspecified means.
      With the exception of the backing memory for <emu-const>SharedArrayBuffer</emu-const> objects
      this communication cannot cause any memory that is mutable in any agent to
      become shared between agents, and the ECMAScript implementation is not
      required to preserve object identity if an object value is sent from one
      agent to another and back.  </p>

    <p> An program within an agent may communicate an ArrayBuffer to a program
      within another agent and in doing so cause the ArrayBuffer to become
      detached in the sending agent.  </p>

    <!--
    <emu-note>
      <p> (Spec draft note) It's arguable that there should be restrictions on
	the value of <b>littleEndian</b> in agents that can communicate, but
	since it would be absurd to require the attribute to be the same on two
	agents that can communicate over the network, where do we draw the line?
	The SAB spec requires agents that can communicate through shared memory
	to have the same value for <b>littleEndian</b>, which seems reasonable,
	since in all other cases there will be marshaling/unmarshaling.  Yet,
	some chips support per-process endianness.  Is it reasonable to have any
	restriction at all? </p>

    <p> An  <em>agent cluster</em> is a maximal set of agents that can in

    <p> In a web browser setting, the  <em>agents</em> comprise a document's main
    thread environment and worker thread environments.  Normal Web Workers must
    be supported.</p>

    <p> There are reasons not to support ServiceWorkers and Shared Workers
    ("non-page workers").  In some browsers, non-page workers may be technically
    incapable of receiving shared memory segments due to process separation.
    Also, if a non-page is communicating through shared memory with a web
    worker, a deadlock can ensue if the non-page worker is waiting to be woken
    up by the web worker and the web worker is suspended or killed because its
    owning document is placed into the history or closed.  </p>

    <p> Browsers will typically outlaw blocking on the main thread.  Browsers
      that support several tabs within the same process may share a single
      execution thread across all the tabs in that case (Firefox does).  </p>

    <emu-note><span class="note">Note</span>
      <p> Several of these issues have been reported as bugs against the WHATWG
      spec,  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=29039">see
      this bug report</a>.  </p>

      <h1><span class="secnum">2.2.1</span>Actions to start a worker<span class="utils"><span class="anchor"><a href="#WebBrowserEmbedding.WorkerSemantics.Start">#</a></span></span></h1>
      <p> (Clarification) The only action required to start a worker is to call
	"new Worker()".  </p>

      <p> (Compatible change) If a worker cannot be started for reasons of
	resource exhaustion (notably, no threads available, including arbitrary
	implementation limits on the number of threads) then an exception must be
	thrown or the error must be reported in some other way, eg as an error
	event.  </p>

      <emu-note><span class="note">Note</span>
        <p> Some browsers currently violate those requirements.  </p>

        <ul>
          <li> In current Firefox, a worker is not actually created until the
            parent has returned to its event loop and allowed the event loop to
            process runnables related to the worker creation.  (This is unlikely to
	    be fixed.)  Not blocking on the main thread mitigates most problems
	    around this problem. 

          </li><li> In current Firefox, there is a per-domain limit on the number of
            workers.  An attempt to create a worker will silently not start the
            worker if the limit has been reached; the worker will be queued and
            started when another worker has terminated.  (A fix is being discussed.)
        
        </li></ul>

        <p> If an agent creates a worker and then -- if the worker is not
          started because the agent does not return to its event loop or because
          the worker is not assigned a thread -- the agent goes to sleep on a
          location waiting for the worker to wake it, there will be a
          deadlock.  </p>

        <p> There are other error situations during worker startup that can't
          necessarily be signaled synchronously, notably, a load error on the URL.
          Those have to be signaled via an event callback, or the creating agent
          must poll the state of the worker to see if it enters an error state

      <p> (Compatible change) Workers may be killed by the browser only for
	specific reasons.  These reasons are TBD but include evicting the owning
	page from the history and closing the owning page.  These reasons do not
	include workers that 'run too long'.  </p>

      <emu-note><span class="note">Note</span>
        <p> Currently the WHATWG spec allows the browser to kill any worker at
          any time.  The purpose of the rule is probably a combination of the
          need to stop runaway scripts (without the normal slow-script dialog)
          and the need to remove workers once a page is evicted from the browser
          cache or a tab is closed.  However, the wording is overly broad.
          Also, common uses of workers for computation conflict with the ability
          to detect 'runaway' agents:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> The worker may perform a genuinely long-running computation
          
          </li><li> The worker will have its own user-implemented 'event' loop,
            communicating synchronously through shared memory; it will not use the
            browser's event loop

      <p> (Compatible(?) change) The worker object should have a read-only

    <p>If a worker is terminated by a call to its terminate method while it is
      blocked in a call to futexWait then the worker is first woken (removed from
      any wait queue) and then immediately terminated (the wakeup is not observed
      by the caller of futexWait).  There are no provisions for cleaning up locked
      state unless the browser supports a close handler.</p>

    <p>If a worker is terminated for any other reason, such as the user agent
      reloading or closing the window or frame, and the worker is blocked in a
      call to futexWait when it is terminated, then the worker is first woken
      (removed from any wait queue) and then immediately terminated (the wakeup is
      not observed by the caller of futexWait).  However, after the running script
      has been terminated the worker's close handler(s) will be run as if the wait
      had not been aborted.</p>

    <p> Some corner cases are unresolved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> If Service Workers have access to shared memory then it is possible
	for a service worker to wait on an action from another agent, say, a
	document's main thread.  But if the document in question is suspended
	(because the user is navigating away from the document) then the service
	worker may never be woken: the document may remain suspended and may
	eventually be evicted from the history.
