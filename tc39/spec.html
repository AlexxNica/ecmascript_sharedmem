<h1>ECMAScript Shared Memory and Atomics</h1>
<p> Revised: 2016-07-13 </p>
<p> Some algorithms and semantics in this proposal are presented as modifications to existing ES262 algorithms and semantics.  The base revision of ES262 for the modifications (here denoted "ES7") is currently f35248729043089b47ccf29e4c47559386f5f6fd (2016-06-29).  At the moment, ES7 (ES2016) section numbering differs from ES6 (ES2015) only for TypedArrays (section 22.2).</p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p> This proposal adds a simple form of shared memory to ECMAScript.
Shared memory is being exposed in the form of a new SharedArrayBuffer
type; the existing TypedArray and DataView types are adapted in such a way
that they can be used to create views on shared memory.  The new
global Atomics object provides atomic operations on shared memory
locations, including operations that can be used to create blocking
synchronization primitives.  Though not a part of this specification,
we intend for the role of "threads" to be played by Web Workers in web
browser environments.<p>

<p> At this time the proposal adds only low-level primitives to
ECMAScript; we expect the developer community to put together
abstractions that are useful in specific domains. </p>

<p> The work has been driven by the following use cases: <p>

<ul>
  <li> Support for threaded code in programs written in other
  languages that are translated to asm.js or plain JS or a combination
  of the two, notably C and C++ but also other, safe, languages.

  <li> Support for hand-written JS or JS+asm.js that makes use of
  multiprocessing facilities for select tasks, such as image
  processing, asset management, or game AI.
</ul>

<p> The proposal makes only very basic assumptions about the required
hardware and should be broadly implementable with good performance.
Prototype implementations of the API are available in Firefox and in
Google Chrome. </p>

<p>This specification constitutes a restatement and formalization of
an earlier
work, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript_sharedmem/blob/master/historical/Spec_JavaScriptSharedMemoryAtomicsandLocks.pdf">the
spec document for which</a> also contains additional rationale,
background information, discussions, implementation notes, and
comments.</p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2016-07-13 -- Many editorial fixes.
  <li> 2016-07-11 -- Rewrote the memory model section, which introduced separate access functions for shared memory, and caused many other changes.
  <li> 2016-07-05 -- Rewrote (and shrunk) the informative Web Browser Embedding section so that it only addresses the requirements of this spec, not how HTML ought to evolve.
  <li> 2016-07-05 -- Rephrased the wait/wake mutual exclusion in terms of critical sections named by (G,i), as the old specification was too strong.
  <li> 2016-06-30 -- Algorithms that are modified relative to their ES262 forms include more context and are more clearly marked, and there's a defined ES262 base revision for those modifications.  Updated section references to reference that revision.
  <li> (Older changelog removed)

    </emu-table>

    <p> Once the values of [[Signifier]], [[IsLockFree1]], and
    [[IsLockFree2]] have been observed by any agent in the agent
    cluster they cannot change. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>The values of [[IsLockFree1]] and [[IsLockFree2]] are not
        necessarily determined by the hardware, but may also reflect
        implementation choices that can vary over time and between
        ECMAScript implementations.</p>

      <p>There is no [[IsLockFree4]] property: 4-byte atomic
        operations are always lock-free. </p>

      <p>Formally, atomic operations are lock-free if, infinitely
        often, some atomic operation finishes in a finite number of
        program steps.  In practice, if an atomic operation is
        implemented with any type of lock the operation is not
        lock-free.  Lock-free does not imply wait-free: there is no
        upper bound on how many machine steps may be required to
        complete a lock-free atomic operation. </p>

      <p>That an atomic access of size <em>n</em> is lock-free does
        not imply anything about the (perceived) atomicity of
        non-atomic accesses of size <em>n</em>, specifically,
        non-atomic accesses may still be performed as a sequence of
        several separate memory accesses.  See ReadSharedMemory and
        WriteSharedMemory for details. </p>
    </emu-note>

  </emu-clause>

  <emu-clause id="ExecutableCodeAndContexts.AgentCluster">
    <h1>Agent Clusters (NEW)</h1>

    <p> An <em>agent cluster</em> is a maximal set of agents that can
      communicate by operating on shared memory. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> Programs within different agents may share memory by
        unspecified means.  At a minimum, the backing memory for
        SharedArrayBuffer objects can be shared among the agents in
        the cluster. </p>

      <p> There may be agents that can communicate by message passing
	that cannot share memory; they are never in the same
	cluster. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> Every agent belongs to exactly one agent cluster. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> The agents in a cluster need not all be alive at some
	particular point in time.  If agent <b>A</b> creates another
	agent <b>B</b>, after which <b>A</b> terminates and <b>B</b>
	creates agent <b>C</b>, the three agents are in the same
	cluster if <b>A</b> could share some memory with <b>B</b>
	and <b>B</b> could share some memory with <b>C</b>. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> All agents within a cluster must have the same value for
      the [[LittleEndian]] property in their respective Agent Records. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> If different agents within an agent cluster have different
        values of [[LittleEndian]] it becomes hard to use shared
        memory for multi-byte data. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> All agents within a cluster must have the same values for
      the [[IsLockFree1]] property in their respective Agent Records; similarly for
      the [[IsLockFree2]] property. </p>

    <p> All agents within a cluster must have different values for
      the [[Signifier]] property in their respective Agent Records. </p>

    <p> An agent cluster is a specification mechanism and need not correspond to
      any particular artefact of an ECMAScript implementation. </p>

    <p> An embedding may deactivate (stop forward progress) or
      activate (resume forward progress) an agent without the agent's
      knowledge or cooperation.  If the embedding does so, it must not
      leave some agents in the cluster active while other agents in
      the cluster are deactivated indefinitely. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> The purpose of the preceding restriction is to avoid a
        situation where an agent deadlocks or starves because another
        agent has been suspended.  For example, if a DOM SharedWorker
        shares memory with a regular worker, and the regular worker is
        suspended while it holds a lock (because the web page the
        regular worker is in is pushed into the window history), and
        the SharedWorker tries to acquire the lock, then the
        SharedWorker will be blocked until the regular worker wakes up
        again, if ever.  Meanwhile other workers trying to access the
        SharedWorker from other web pages will starve. </p>

      <p> The implication of the restriction is that it will not be
        possible to share memory between agents that don't belong to
        the same suspend/wake collective within the embedding. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p> An embedding may terminate an agent without any of the agent's
      cluster's other agents' prior knowledge or cooperation.  If an
      agent is terminated not by programmatic action of its own or of
      another agent in the cluster but by forces external to the
      cluster, then the embedding must choose one of two strategies:
      Either terminate all the agents in the cluster, or provide
      reliable APIs that allow the agents in the cluster to coordinate
      so that at least one remaining member of the cluster will be
      able to detect the termination, with the termination data
      containing enough information to identify the agent that was
      terminated. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> Examples of that type of termination are: operating systems
        or users terminating agents that are running in separate
        processes; the embedding itself terminating an agent that is
        running in-process with the other agents when per-agent
        resource accounting indicates that the agent is runaway. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-note>
      <p> This proposal additionally suggests (see later text) that if
        termination is signaled then the signal creates a
        synchronizes-with edge in the memory ordering. </p>

      <h1>Memory model</h1>

      <p> The memory model determines when a particular read from
        shared memory may observe a particular write to shared memory.
        This is straight-forward in the case when the program has no
        data races, as all shared memory reads and writes are then
        clearly ordered and reads can only see writes that happened
        before them in the order.  When the program has data races,
        however, reads may observe writes that appear to come out of
        the past, the future, or should not have happened, as some of
        the reads and writes (to the same location) that are unordered
        relative to each other may access the same memory without
        coordination.  This section provides rules that determine when
        a data race is not present in the program and also provides a
        conventional model that determines event ordering in data race
        free programs; it then provides additional rules that
        determine the allowable effects of data races. </p>

      <p> ECMAScript shared memory obeys very weak type discipline, in
        that the byte array of a Shared Data Block can be aliased by
        TypedArrays of different types and accessed without natural
        alignment via DataViews, and also in that atomic operations
        must be applied to cells that are not exclusively atomic.  (In
        this it is similar to the "low-level atomics" of C.)  In
        contrast, correct synchronization to achieve data race freedom
        requires a stronger type discipline where a location used for
        synchronization during some segment of the program's lifetime
        is used only for synchronization and where all atomic
        operations that touch the location during that segment use the
        exact same access range.  The weak type discipline thus
        complicates the description of synchronization. </p>

          augments with operational details to specify what might
          happen during data races.  If review indicates that this

      <emu-clause id="AtomicsObject.Fundamentals">
        <h1>Fundamentals</h1>

        <p> Shared memory accesses (reads and writes) are divided into
          two groups, atomic accesses and data accesses, defined
          below. </p>

        <p> An <em>event</em> in an agent is a either a data access (a
          <em>non-synchronizing event</em>), or an atomic access or a
          call to Atomics.wake or Atomics.wait (<em>synchronizing
            events</em>).  Synchronizing events can additionally be
          embedding-specific. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> Examples of embedding-specific synchronizing events that
            should be accounted for are: sending a SharedArrayBuffer
            from one agent to another (e.g., by `postMessage` in a
            browser), starting and stopping agents, and communicating
            within the agent cluster via channels other than shared
            memory. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> Program transformations by a compiler or the hardware must
          not reorder an agent's non-synchronizing events with its
          synchronizing events, nor reorder its synchronizing events
          with each other. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> The prohibition on reordering synchronizing events is
            stronger than in most mainstream concurrent languages. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> The <em>program order</em> of an agent is a total ordering
          of the agent's events that is consistent with the semantics
          of the ECMAScript program running in that agent. </p>

        <p> The <em>execution order</em> of an agent cluster is a
          total order of the events of an execution of the programs in
          the cluster; the execution order must be consistent with
          each agent's program order. </p>

        <p> Shared memory access is always performed by two primitive
          subroutines, ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory.  These
          subroutines never perform non-shared-memory access. </p>

        <p> Let the <em>candidate atomic accesses</em> (candidate
          atomic reads, candidate atomic writes) be those algorithm
          steps that are labeled "With atomic access to shared memory"
          in the algorithms in subsequent sections, ie, the simple
          `load` and `store` operations and the read-modify-write
          operations `add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `xor`, `exchange`, and
          `compareExchange`; the accesses will ultimately be performed
          by ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory.  A
          read-modify-write atomic access is considered a read
          followed by a write. </p>

        <p> Let the <em>candidate data accesses</em> (candidate data
          reads, candidate data writes) be those invocations of
          ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory that are not part of
          the candidate atomic accesses. </p>

        <p> Let the <em>access range</em> of a shared memory access be
          the memory cells read or written by the access.  (These cells
          are always consecutive and within a single Shared Data
          Block.) </p>

        <p> A candidate atomic read R is <em>viable</em> in an
          execution order E if it reads the value written by a
          candidate atomic write W that precedes R in E, W and R have
          identical access ranges, and there exists no write V in E
          s.t. W precedes V and V precedes R and V writes to any byte
          in the access range of R. </p>

        <p> If a candidate atomic read _R_ is not viable in some
          execution order, then _R_ is simply <em>not viable</em>. </p>

        <p> Finally, let the <em>atomic accesses</em> of the program
          be those candidate atomic accesses that are viable, and let
          the <em>data accesses</em> be the union of the candidate
          data accesses and the non-viable candidate atomic
          accesses. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> One goal of this section is to define data races, which
            means defining happens-before, which means defining
            synchronization order.  Synchronization order depends on
            well-defined atomic accesses: An atomic read is
            well-defined for synchronization only if it reads from an
            atomic write to the same access range, where that write
            does not race with any data writes or with atomic writes
            to an overlapping but not-equal access range.  We can't
            use the definition of data races directly to determine
            well-definedness (or the definition would be circular),
            and instead use the notion of visibility of writes in the
            execution order. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <emu-note>
          <p> (Spec draft notes) </p>

          <p> Claim: After requiring atomic reads to be viable there
            may still be data races (by the definition below) that
            involve atomic writes, but none of them will be observed
            by atomic reads.  Hence synchronization order is not
            affected by data races on atomics. </p>

          <p> Without a working notion of viability it is not clear how
            we can salvage an axiomatic formalization of the memory model. </p>

          <p> The notion of viability used here is fairly strong.  It
            would be interesting to try to loosen it up. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> Similarly, the `wait` event is viable (and thus considered
          as a synchronizing event) only if the atomic read it
          performs is viable. </p>

        <p> Synchronizing events are then performed in a single total
          order -- known as the <em>synchronization order</em> -- that
          is a sub-sequence of the execution order (and hence
          consistent with each agent's program order).  This induces
          a <em>synchronized-with</em> relation on actions: </p>

        <ul>
          <li> An atomic write of a location synchronizes-with all
            subsequent (later in the synchronization order) atomic reads of that
            location.
          <li> A `wake` call synchronizes-with a `wait` call that
            returns as a result of the `wake`.
          <li> In an embedding-specific synchronizing event that has a
            sender and a receiver (such as sending a SharedArrayBuffer
            from one agent to another), the sending action
            synchronizes-with the receiving action.
        </ul>

        <p> We can now define the happens-before relation, which gives
          rise to definitions of data races.  An event A <em>happens
          before</em> another event B if either:</p>

        <ul>
          <li> A precedes B in the agent's program order,
          <li> A synchronizes-with B, or
          <li> A happens before C and C happens before B (transitivity).
        </ul>

        <p> Executions must be such that <em>happens before</em> is
          irreflexive (acyclic). </p>

        <p> Two shared memory accesses whose access ranges intersect
          constitute a <em>data race</em> if neither happens before
          the other, at least one of them is a write, and they are not
          both atomic writes to the same access range. </p>

        <p> If an atomic access is not in a data race, then the shared
          memory reads and writes issued by the atomic access must be
          performed indivisibly (following the rules of
          ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory), and in a
          read-modify-write atomic access no write by another agent must
          be allowed to execute between the read and the write. </p>
      </emu-clause>

      <emu-clause id="AtomicsObject.SeqCst">
        <h1>Sequential consistency</h1>

        <p> An execution of a set of events is <em>sequentially
            consistent</em> if the events occur in an execution order,
            and a read R of a location L sees a write W s.t. W
            precedes R in the execution order, and there is no other
            write V to L s.t. W precedes V and V precedes R. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> Observe that a sequentially consistent execution can still
            have a data race since sequential consistency only requires
            a certain execution behavior for a specific ordering of an
            event set. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> The program will appear to be sequentially consistent if
          all sequentially consistent executions of the program have
          no data races.  In that case, the following hold: </p>

        <ul>
          <li> A data access read R only sees a write W that happens
            before R, where there is no write V such that V happens
            before R and W happens before V.

          <li> An atomic read R sees either the last preceding (in
            synchronization order) atomic write U to the same
            location, or a non-atomic write W that happens before R,
            where there is no write V such that V happens before R and
            W happens before V.
        </ul>
      </emu-clause>

      <emu-clause id="AtomicsObject.DataRaces">
        <h1>Data races</h1>

        <p> In a data race the write-to-read visibility guarantees
          provided by sequential consistency do not hold; an atomic
          access in a data race is not indivisible; and generally
          programs with data races do not behave as if they were
          sequentially consistent.  Data races expose the effects of
          program transformations in the compiler and in the hardware,
          which are unintuitive and platform-specific.  ECMAScript
          programs with data races are safe (races cannot subvert the
          language implementation, they affect only the memory
          locations in Shared Data Blocks), but the values resulting
          from a data race are often hard to predict.  The effects of
          data races include observing values that, within limits,
          appear to come from the past (because they should have been
          written before other values, which have not been seen) or
          from the future (because they should have been written after
          other values, which have not been seen), or which should not
          exist at all (because some conflicting writes may interleave
          the bytes being written). </p>

        <p> When an atomic access that is in a data race performs a
          read-write pair of memory accesses, those accesses are
          performed as if the qualifier "With atomic access to shared
          memory" were omitted from the algorithms below. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> Hence, a write access from another agent may be allowed
            to execute between the read and the write of the pair,
            and, as defined by ReadSharedMemory and
            WriteSharedMemory, even the individual accesses in the
            atomic access may not be executed atomically. </p>

          <p> For example, non-lock-free atomic operations will allow
            such a race to be observed. </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> The following rules restrict program behavior in the
          presence of data races: </p>

        <ul>
          <!-- Deoptimization (maybe, unlikely); rematerialization -->
          <li> Any given read must only observe a single value.  (For
            example, if what is semantically a single read in the
            program is executed multiple times then the program is
            subsequently allowed to observe only one of the values
            read.)

          <li> Any given read must only observe value changes in memory
            that follow from program semantics.  (For example, the
            compiler or hardware may not introduce certain observable
            writes, such as using read-modify-write operations on a
            larger location to write a smaller datum, writing a value
            to memory that the program could not have written, or
            spuriously writing a just-read value back to the location
            it was read from.  Note that byte interleavings resulting
            from races, described below, is within program semantics.)

          <li> Any given read must only observe values that have been
            produced by the program's execution.  (For example, the
            compiler or hardware may not speculate about a value and
            then use that value to justify the speculation.)
        </ul>

        <emu-note>
          <p> Examples of program transformations that remain valid
            (assuming no intra-agent semantic change and no reordering
            with respect to synchronizing events) are: merging
            multiple data reads from the same location, reordering
            data reads from different locations, introducing
            speculative data reads, merging multiple data writes to
            the same location, and reordering data writes to different
            locations.  </p>
        </emu-note>

        <p> The subroutines ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory
          define the valid outcomes of data races.  In general a race
          allows a value to be read that is an interleaving of bytes
          being written and bytes already in memory.  However,
          ReadSharedMemory and WriteSharedMemory have special
          provisions that allow some classes of data races to have
          somewhat predictable outcomes. </p>

        <emu-note>
          <p> The special provisions are present because all hardware
            supports the specialized behavior and because that
            behavior is valuable to programs in practice.  Note,

          `or`, `xor`, or `exchange`) on a datum of size _n_ bytes

          outside the _n_ bytes comprising the datum, then
          Atomics.isLockFree(_n_) will return *true*.
          High-performance algorithms will use Atomics.isLockFree to
          determine whether to use locks or atomic operations in

<emu-clause id="WebBrowserEmbedding">
  <h1>Web browser embedding (informative)</h1>

  <p> This section outlines how the Shared Memory and Atomics
    specification fits into the current web ecosystem with the minimum
    amount of change to that ecosystem.  This section is not part of
    the proposal, it is informative only.  </p>

  <p> In a web browser an <em>agent</em> is an HTML <em>event
    loop</em> <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loops">[here]</a>.
    The event loop is realized as either a main thread (which may be
    shared among tabs, as it is in Firefox) or some type of worker
    thread.  The event loops are running jobs in the sense of ES262,
    and the forward-progress requirement of this specification
    (section&nbsp;3.1.1) is generally met as long as each agent has
    its own dedicated operating system thread or shared-thread agents
    can't block. </p>

  <p> Browsers will typically let agents that run on the browser's
    main thread have [[CanBlock]] equal to *false*, to prevent blocking the
    UI and to allow the main thread to do work on behalf of other
    threads. </p>

  <p> Normal ("dedicated") `Worker`s must be supported as agents for
    this proposal to make much sense. </p>

  <p> Memory will be shared among agents by using `postMessage` to
    transmit SharedArrayBuffer objects or TypedArray objects that
    have SharedArrayBuffer buffers; this requires an extension to
    the Structured Clone mechanism.  There is agreement on the general
    syntax and semantics for that extension. </p>

  <p> Agent-to-agent communication extends the synchronizes-with relation
    of the program, as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li> The call to the `Worker` constructor in the parent
      synchronizes-with the execution of the main script in the worker.

    <li> (Worker termination is not directly observable in current
      browsers, but this is a moot point; see below.)

    <li> A `postMessage` to another agent synchronizes-with the event
      that fires in the agent.
  </ul>

  <p> So long as the browser does not allow a `ServiceWorker` or
    `SharedWorker` ("non-page worker") to share memory with a `Worker`
    it will not violate the suspend/wake cohort rule of this
    specification (section&nbsp;3.3).  The restriction on sharing
    memory can be implemented in the extension to the Structured Clone
    mechanism.  For example, a non-page worker may simply not be
    allowed to receive shared memory (leading to a null value or an
    error signal).  There is not yet any agreement on this point, but
    it is clear that the restriction must be on the receiving side of
    the communication, as the sender may be sending on a `MessagePort`
    that is not yet connected, but may in the future be connected to
    either a valid or invalid recipient. </p>

  <p> At the moment, I believe dedicated workers are in the same
    process as their owning tab in all browsers, so if the process
    crashes then the workers will crash too.  I also don't know any
    reason a browser should forcibly terminate a worker except when a
    tab is closed.  In sum, the termination signaling requirement of
    this specification (section&nbsp;3.3) is probably met by existing
    browsers. </p>

  <p> The web platform should evolve to serve the shared memory use
    case better: by incorporating inspectable worker state and worker
    lifecycle events, and by tightening the wording in the HTML spec
    (currently the browser is allowed to kill a worker at any time for
    any reason, which is not quite what we want).  WebIDL should
    evolve to allow Web APIs to be described as to when they can and
    cannot receive shared memory parameters.  However, only an
    extension to the Structured Clone algorithm is needed to support
    the Shared Memory and Atomics specification in practice on current
    browsers. </p>
