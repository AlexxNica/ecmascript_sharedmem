  <p> Tests that shared memory cannot be sent to or from a
    SharedWorker instance. </p>

  <p> If everything goes OK there should be no
  lines below saying "SHOULD NOT HAPPEN", and instead there should be
  lines saying "SUCCESS - Failed to send".</p>

  <p> Also check the console, there should be nothing unusual there. </p>
