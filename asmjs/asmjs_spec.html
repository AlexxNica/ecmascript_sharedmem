<h1>ECMAScript Shared Memory and Atomics - asm.js addenda</h1>
<p> Revised: 2015-08-28 </p>

<emu-intro id="intro">
<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p> This document defines the changes and amendments to asm.js
  semantics to support
  <a href="https://github.com/lars-t-hansen/ecmascript_sharedmem">the proposal for ECMAScript shared memory and atomics</a>.
  Please refer to that document for full information about the semantics. </p>
  
<p>This specification is a restatement of
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19X8Geo_7OMyyUICMvIqzEgSDms0rRMDODdMIkXIm9m0/edit?usp=sharing">an earlier work</a>,
  along with later bug fixes.  The earlier work is obsolete. </p>

<p>Changelog:</p>
<ul>
  <li> 2015-08-28 -- initial translation from the original proposal.
</ul>
</emu-intro>

<emu-clause id="views">
  <h1>Views</h1>

  <p> New constructors ~SharedInt8Array~, ~SharedUint8Array~, ..., 
    ~SharedFloat32Array~, and ~SharedFloat64Array~ can be used to
    create views on the heap memory if the heap memory is a
    SharedArrayBuffer. </p>

  <p> It is a static error to reference, even for the purposes of
    storing it in a local binding, a shared-view constructor (eg,
    SharedInt32Array) and an unshared-view constructor (eg,
    Float64Array) in the same compilation unit. </p>

  <p> It is a link error to map a shared view onto an unshared buffer,
    or an unshared view onto a shared buffer. </p>

  <p> Loading from and storing to the heap have the same semantics
    regardless of whether the heap is shared or unshared memory. </p>

</emu-clause>

<emu-clause id="atomics">
  <h1>Atomics</h1>

  <p> There is a new known stdlib object ~Atomics~.  This object
    provides a number of known, static methods, a subset of the
    methods provided in the full specification. </p>
  
  <emu-note>
    <p>The following Atomics names are not available as intrinsics in asm.js:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Atomics.futexWait()
      <li> Atomics.futexWake()
      <li> Atomics.futexWakeOrRequeue()
      <li> Atomics.OK
      <li> Atomics.NOTEQUAL
      <li> Atomics.TIMEDOUT
    </ul>

    <p> The futex methods can be accessed through the FFI (with the
      heap passed implicitly) and the operation result values can be
      expanded into constant values, as they have known values.</p>

  </emu-note>
  
  <emu-clause id="atomics.load">
    <h1>Atomics.load(view, index)</h1>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.load.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>
      
      <p> The _view_ must name a shared integer-typed array. </p>

      <p> The _index_ must be an expression of static type Intish.  If
      the byte size of _view_ is not 1 then _index_ must have the form
      _C_, where _C_ is a constant, or the form _E>>K_, where _E_ is
      some expression and _K_ is a constant that is the log-base-2 of
      the element byte size of _view_. </p>

      <p> The result type of Atomics.load is Signed. (BUG) </p>
      
      <emu-note>
	<p> Treating atomic accesses as "syntax" rather than as
	"calls" fits in with how they will be used and allows for
	simplifictions in code generation, and is not a particular
	hardship. </p>
      </emu-note>

    </emu-clause>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.load.dynamic">
      <h1>Dynamic behavior</h1>

      <p> If the _index_ is not in the range of _view_ then a memory
      barrier appropriate to the operation is performed, no read or
      write operation is performed, and the result value is zero. (BUG) </p>

  <emu-clause id="atomics.fence">
    <h1> Atomics.fence() </h1>

    <p> Implements a full memory barrier. </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p> Atomics.fence() is no longer a part of the Shared Memory and
      Atomics specification and we do not expect to reintroduce it.
      It is implemented in Firefox, for now, but may be removed. </p>
    </emu-note>

    <emu-clause id="atomics.fence.static">
      <h1>Static constraints</h1>

      <p> The result type is Int, a boolean value. </p>

      <emu-note>
	<p> Again, treating Atomics.isLockFree as syntax rather than
	  as a call fits in with how it will be used and provides
	  guarantees that it will be resolved at compile time. </p>
